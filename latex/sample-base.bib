	abstract = {Abstract. The NASA MEaSUREs Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS\_LIVE) project seeks to accelerate understanding of critical glaciers and ice sheet processes by providing researchers with global, low-latency, comprehensive and state-of-the-art records of surface velocities and elevations as observed from space. Here we describe the image-pair ice velocity product and processing methodology for ESA Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate improvements to the core processing algorithm for dense offset tracking, “autoRIFT”, that provides finer resolution and higher accuracy data products with improved computational efficiency when compared to earlier versions. A novel calibration is applied to the data to correct for Sentinel-1A/B subswath- and full swath-dependent geolocation errors caused by systematic issues with the instruments. Sentinel-1’s C-band images are affected by variations in the total electron content of the ionosphere that results in large velocity errors in the azimuth (along-track) direction. To reduce these effects slant-range (line-of-sight or LOS) velocities are used and accompanied by LOS parameters that support map coordinate (x/y) velocity inversion from ascending and descending slant-range offset measurements, as derived from 2 image-pairs. The described product and methods comprise the MEaSUREs ITS\_LIVE Sentinel-1 Image-Pair Glacier and Ice Sheet Surface Velocities: Version 2 (https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov).},

	abstract = {During the last decade, the number of available satellite observations has increased significantly, allowing for far more frequent measurements of the glacier speed. Appropriate methods of post-processing need to be developed to efficiently deal with the large volumes of data generated and relatively large intrinsic errors associated with the measurements. Here, we process and combine together measurements of ice velocity of Russell Gletscher in Greenland from three satellites—Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8, creating a multi-year velocity database with high temporal and spatial resolution. We then investigate post-processing methodologies with the aim of generating corrected, ordered, and simplified time series. We tested rolling mean and median, cubic spline regression, and linear non-parametric local regression (LOWESS) smoothing algorithms to reduce data noise, evaluated the results against ground-based GPS in one location, and compared the results between two locations with different characteristics. We found that LOWESS provides the best solution for noisy measurements that are unevenly distributed in time. Using this methodology with these sensors, we can robustly derive time series with temporal resolution of 2–3 weeks and improve the accuracy on the ice velocity to about 10 m/yr, or a factor of three compared to the initial measurements. The presented methodology could be applied to the entire Greenland ice sheet with an aim of reconstructing comprehensive sub-seasonal ice flow dynamics and mass balance.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Fully understanding how glaciers respond to environmental change will require new methods to help us identify the onset of ice acceleration events and observe how dynamic signals propagate within glaciers. In particular, observations of ice dynamics on seasonal timescales may offer insights into how a glacier interacts with various forcing mechanisms throughout the year. The task of generating continuous ice velocity time series that resolve seasonal variability is made difficult by the finite integration time over which ice velocities are measured from optical and repeat SAR imagery, and by a spotty satellite record that contains no optical observations throughout dark, polar winters. In this paper, we describe a method of analyzing feature-tracked velocities to characterize the magnitude and timing of seasonal ice dynamic variability. Our method is agnostic to data gaps and is able to recover climatological average winter velocities regardless of the availability of direct observations during winter. Using characteristic image acquisition times and error distributions from Antarctic image pairs in the ITS\_LIVE dataset, we generate synthetic ice velocity time series, then apply our method to recover imposed magnitudes of seasonal variability within ±1.4 m yr−1. We then validate the techniques by comparing our results to GPS data collected on Russell Glacier in Greenland. The methods presented here may be applied to better understand how ice dynamic signals propagate on seasonal timescales, and what mechanisms control the flow of the world’s ice.},
